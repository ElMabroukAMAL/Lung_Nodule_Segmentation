## Project Overview

Implemented a U-Net architecture for image segmentation tasks:

- Designed the encoder with convolutional and max-pooling layers to capture context.
- Constructed the decoder with up-sampling and convolutional layers for precise localization.
- Combined encoder and decoder paths via skip connections to enhance segmentation accuracy.
